I had been brainstorming ideas for the CLI data gem project when a friend of mind kept sending me links to dogs she was thinking of adopting.  The brainstorm was called off and I decided to scrape data from the Austin Pets Alive website into a  navegable CLI.

Arguably the best part about browsing through these dogs is the photos, which will not be visible within the CLI.  So as part of the second level details, there's a link to the page specific to that dog, complete with photos.

While the end result is fully functional - it's probably not practical in any sense.  A browse through the website would be quicker and easier.  The process of creating it, however, was a good exercise for me.  I mostly followed along Avi's example:  outlining in general how I wanted it to work,  creating placeholders when necessary, replacing the placeholders with functional scraping tools and then some final tweaks to the interface and efforts to offset potential errors.

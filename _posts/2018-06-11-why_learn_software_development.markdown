The simplest answer to this question is that I am a lifelong learner. Most of us spend a good chunk of our days in "career mode" which makes it a near-necessity for me to find work that includes constant learning. Coding, more than most other career paths, seems to be a process of continual learning that will be most likely to keep me engaged.

I first learned a bit of coding (C++) in high school. I have always had a natural affinity for logic and a drive to find the most efficient ways to do things - this is inherent from writing code to packing a suitcase. I later taught myself some HTML and CSS - I feel like I have been circling this pursuit for some time and I am excited to finally jump in.

The final reason that I'm learning to code is the potential flexibility the skillset will hopefully offer me eventually. I thrive in a remote working environment and I like living in different places.
